# Identifying coding regions using ```TransDecoder``` and ```hmmer```

First, we will use [TransDecoder](https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder) for two porpuses, identify dentify long open reading frames (ORFs) using ```TransDecoder.LongOrfs``` make final predictions about which ORFs in our transcripts are real with ```TransDecoder.Predict```.
[hmmer](http://hmmer.org/) will be use for searching sequence databases for sequence homologs.
