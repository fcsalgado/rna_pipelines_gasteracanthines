This repository contains scripts to replicate the results obtained in our study. Most of the input files required to run these analyses are available on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/18216737). Raw reads are available on the [SRA]().

## Transcriptome assembly

All pipelines required to replicate the transcriptome assembly are available here on GitHub. For a step-by-step description, please refer to the Methods section of our manuscript.

## Differential expression analyses

To replicate our differential expression analyses, please follow this [R script](https://fcsalgado.github.io/rna_pipelines_gasteracanthines/deseq_go_amix_perGene.html).
